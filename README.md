# Massively for Astro

Massively is a free, fully responsive HTML5 + CSS3 site template designed by [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn) for
[HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) and released for free under the [Creative Commons license](https://html5up.net/license).
Remixed for [Astro](https://astro.build) by [@d_bozhinovski](https://twitter.com/d_bozhinovski).

This is a port of the template for Astro, to be used as a theme. It's been Astroized as much as I deemed practical. I
imagine it will need to change and evolve if there's interest in it, so I'm open to suggestions (and PRs) on how to
Astroize it further.
